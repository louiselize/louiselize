### HiğŸ‘‹

My name is Louise LizÃ© and I am a computer science student and I am doing a double degree at UTC and UQAC.
I am looking for an internship in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science for september 2023 ğŸ“ˆ.

I am a hard worker and I am eager to learn new skills and gain experience in the field!

I am excited to explore the opportunities available preferably in Canada but I remain open to all suggestionsâš¡
