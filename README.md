### Welcome to my Github profile! 👋


My name is Louise Lizé, and I am a computer science student engineer with a specialization in AI and Data Science 📈. 

Although I am originally studying at the French engineering university [UTC](https://www.utc.fr), I am currently pursuing a double degree program at [UQAC](https://www.uqac.ca) in Canada, which has allowed me to expand my horizons and gain a unique perspective on my field of study. 

🔭 I’m currently working at [Thales DIS](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security) as a CX management intern, focusing on cloud migration within the company since September 2023. I am actively engaged in data analysis while simultaneously learning to understand cloud transformation.

You can explore a selection of my favorite projects, both those I completed during my studies at school and those I pursued independently outside of the classroom. 💻

Please feel free to explore my repositories and connect with [me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/louise-lize/) on LinkedIn!
