### Welcome to my Github profile! ðŸ‘‹


My name is Louise LizÃ©, and I am a computer science student engineer with a specialization in AI and Data Science ðŸ“ˆ. 

Although I am originally studying at the French engineering university [UTC](https://www.utc.fr), I am currently pursuing a double degree program at [UQAC](https://www.uqac.ca) in Canada, which has allowed me to expand my horizons and gain a unique perspective on my field of study. 

As I look ahead to my future career, I am eager to gain industry experience through a 6-month internship starting in September 2023, with a preference for opportunities located in Montreal. However, I am also open to exploring opportunities elsewhere in the world. ðŸ”­

On this platform, you can explore a selection of my favorite projects, both those I completed during my studies at school and those I pursued independently outside of the classroom. ðŸ’»

Please feel free to explore my repositories and connect with [me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/louise-lize/) on LinkedIn!
